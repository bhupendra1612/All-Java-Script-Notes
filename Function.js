/*
1) JavaScript Functions: A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

2) JavaScript Function Syntax: function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, ....) {
  // code to be executed
};

3) Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

4) Function Invocation: The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
    a) When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
    b) When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
    c) Automatically (self invoked)

5) Function Return: When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller".

6) The () Operator: The () operator invokes (calls) the function. Accessing a function with incorrect parameters can return an incorrect answer.

7) Functions Used as Variable Values: Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations. 
let x = toCelsius(77);
let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";
let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";
