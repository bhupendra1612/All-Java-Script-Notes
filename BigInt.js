/* 
1) JavaScript BigInt: JavaScript BigInt variables are used to store big integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.  

2) JavaScript Integer Accuracy: JavaScript integers are only accurate up to 15 digits.

3) In JavaScript, all numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format. 

4) BigInt Operators: Operators that can be used on a JavaScript Number can also be used on a BigInt. Arithmetic between a BigInt and a Number is not allowed (type conversion lose information).

5) BigInt Decimals: A BigInt can not have decimals.

6) BigInt Hex, Octal and Binary: BigInt can also be written in hexadecimal, octal, or binary notation like: (let hex = 0x20000000000003n;
let oct = 0o400000000000000003n;
let bin = 0b100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011n;    )
