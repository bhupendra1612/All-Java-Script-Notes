/*
1) Types of JavaScript Operators:
    a) Arithmetic Operators
    b) Assignment Operators
    c) Comparison Operators
    d) Logical Operators
    e) Type Operators
    f) Bitwise Operators
    g) Ternary Operators
    h) String Operators

2) Arithmetic Operators
    a) + : addition
    b) - : substraction
    c) * : multiplication
    d) / : division
    e) % : modules
    f) ** : expontial
    g) ++ : increment by one
    h) -- : decrement by one

3) Assignment Operators
    a)  = : x = y
    b) += : x = x+y
    c) -= : x = x-y
    d) *= : x = x*y
    e) /= : x = x/y
    f) %= : x%y
    g) **= : x**y
    h) The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

4) Comparison Operator
    a) == : equal to
    b) != : not equal value
    c) > : greater than
    d) < : less than
    f) ? : ternary
    g) >= : greater than or equal to
    h) <= : less than or equal to
    i) === : equal value and equal types
    j) !== : not equal value and not equal types

5) Logical Operator
    a) ! : logical Not
    b) && : logical And
    c) || : logical Or

6) Type Operators
    a) typeof: Returns the type of a variable
    b) instanceof: Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

7) Bitwise Operators
a) 


8) Ternary Operators
a)

9) String Operators


10) Shift Assignment Operators: 
    a) <<= : x = x << y
    b) >>= : x = x >> y
    c) >>>=	: x = x >>> y

11) Bitwise Assignment Operators
    a) &= :	x = x & y
    b) ^= :	x = x ^ y
    c) |= :	x = x | y

12) Logical Assignment Operators
    a) &&= : x = x && (x = y)
    b) ||= : x = x || (x = y)
    c) ??= : x = x ?? (x = y)


10) JavaScript Arithmetic Operator: A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers. The two numbers can be literals. The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands. The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator. like: 100 + 100, 100 is operand.

11) Operator Precedence: Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-). And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses. When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first. When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction or multiplication and division), they are computed from left to right.
